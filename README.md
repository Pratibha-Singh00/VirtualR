## ✨ Project Overview

🔧 In this project, I built a **landing page** for a **Virtual Reality software company** using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
☁️ The project is fully deployed on **Vercel** and is 100% **responsive** across all screen sizes.

Here’s a breakdown of the sections I developed:

- 🔝 **Sticky Navbar** – Beautiful blur backdrop with a responsive **drawer** on smaller screens
- 🎯 **Hero Section** – Includes gradient text and an autoplay embedded video
- 🌟 **Feature Section** – Lists all product features with clean layout
- 🔄 **Workflow Section** – Contains images and checklist-style highlights
- 💰 **Pricing Section** – Three interactive pricing cards: **Free**, **Pro**, and **Enterprise**
- 🗣️ **Testimonial Section** – Showcases customer reviews in an appealing layout
- 🔻 **Footer** – Includes all essential links and branding elements

🧪 Built with **clean, reusable components**, modern animations, and fully mobile-friendly layout!

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
